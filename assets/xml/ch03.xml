	<intro>You will understand the methods and variables after completing this chapter</intro>

	<sectTitle1>Defining a method</sectTitle1>
	<sectTitle2>Calling a method</sectTitle2>
	<sectTitle3>Passing Parameters by Values</sectTitle3>
	<sectTitle4>Overloading Methods</sectTitle4>
	<sectTitle5>The scope of Variables</sectTitle5>

	<sect1>A method consists of its method name, parameters, return value type, and body</sect1>
	<sect2>When calling a method this executes the code in the method</sect2>
	<sect3>The arguments are passed by value to parameters when invoking a method</sect3>
	<sect4>The overloading of methods allows you to define the methods with the same name as long as thier signatures are different</sect4>
	<sect5>The scope of the variable is the part of the program where the varible can be referenced</sect5>
